# READ THIS README BEFORE OPENING FILES

You will be working with a partner to practice technical interviews. One person will present (be the interviewer) for Red. One person will present (be the interviewer) for Blue.


## Step 1
**Decide with your partner who will present which questiosn now**

DO NOT YET LOOK AT ANY OF THE FILES in `src`

## Step 2
Each of you should separately fork and clone this repository. You should each have your own fork.

DO NOT YET LOOK AT ANY OF THE FILES in `src`

## Step 3 
Take 10 minutes to separately each look at the solutions for the questions you are going to present.
Spend more time looking at the second solution, because it's a problem you haven't seen before.

If you are going to present Red, look at `RedSolution1.java` and `RedSolution2.java`
If you are going to present Blue, look at `BlueSolution1.java` and `BlueSolution2.java`

DO NOT LOOK AT THE FILES FOR THE OTHER QUESTION.

Read through the solution. Understand the question that is being asked, and how the sample solution works. 

## Step 4
After 10 minutes, choose one person to be interviewer first. 

Prepare a timer for 25 minutes, but do not start it yet.

Open the question on the candidate's computer. For example, if you are presenting (are the interviewer for) Blue, then your partner (the candidate) should open `BlueQ1.java` on their computer. Both partners should look at the candidate's computer together throughout the interview.

The interviewer should read the question out loud to the candidate. Once the interviewer is done reading, start the timer.

During the interview, the following is allowed:
- Running the code
- Running the tests
- Adding print statements
- Asking the interviewer questions
- Using web searches to search for Java syntax (e.g "how to convert a character to uppercase Java")

DO NOT USE AI AT ANY POINT

If the candidate solves the problem and is passing all tests before time is up, switch to the next problem. Keep the same timer going throughout.

## Step 5 (Once time is up)
Once the 25 minute timer goes off, stop the interview, regardless of how much progress was made. It is OK and expected not to finish! Take a short (5-10 minute) break. Then switch roles and do the interview for the other question.


## Step 6
If you did not finish your problems, please complete them for homework. Make a PR against the original repo and submit a link to your PR on Canvas. You can optionally implement the other problem on your own if you want extra practice.
